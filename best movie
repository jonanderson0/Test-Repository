The best movie I watched this summer was the martian. It's was my favourite movie to watch because a guy got trapped on mars and he found a way to work and provide food for himself within a certain amount of time.
In the movie a group of people get to go into a rocket and fly up to mars. After sometime it's was time for them to return to earth. A sandstorm started to have an affect on them getting back to the rocket which pushed back one of their members which caused him to try and find a way to live on planet mars.
